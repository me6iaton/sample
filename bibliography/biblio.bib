@article{Abbott2008,
  abstract = {Unless you're a mathematician, the chances of you reading any novels about geometry are probably slender. But if you read only two in your life, these are the ones. Taken together, they form a couple of accessible and charming explanations of geometry and physics for the curious non-mathematician. Flatland, which is also available under separate cover, was published in 1880 and imagines a two-dimensional world inhabited by sentient geometric shapes who think their planar world is all there is. But one Flatlander, a Square, discovers the existence of a third dimension and the limits of his world's assumptions about reality and comes to understand the confusing problem of higher dimensions. The book is also quite a funny satire on society and class distinctions of Victorian England. The further mathematical fantasy, Sphereland, published 60 years later, revisits the world of Flatland in time to explore the mind-bending theories created by Albert Einstein, whose work so completely altered the scientific understanding of space, time, and matter. Among Einstein's many challenges to common sense were the ideas of curved space, an expanding universe and the fact that light does not travel in a straight line. Without use of the mathematical formulae that bar most non- scientists from an understanding of Einstein's theories, Sphereland gives lay readers ways to start comprehending these confusing but fundamental questions of our reality.},

  abstract = {We test two different methods of using near-infrared extinction to estimate distances to dark clouds in the first quadrant of the Galaxy using large near-infrared (Two Micron All Sky Survey and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey) surveys. Very long baseline interferometry parallax measurements of masers around massive young stars provide the most direct and bias-free measurement of the distance to these dark clouds. We compare the extinction distance estimates to these maser parallax distances. We also compare these distances to kinematic distances, including recent re-calibrations of the Galactic rotation curve. The extinction distance methods agree with the maser parallax distances (within the errors) between 66\% and 100\% of the time (depending on method and input survey) and between 85\% and 100\% of the time outside of the crowded Galactic center. Although the sample size is small, extinction distance methods reproduce maser parallax distances better than kinematic distances; furthermore, extinction distance methods do not suffer from the kinematic distance ambiguity. This validation gives us confidence that these extinction methods may be extended to additional dark clouds where maser parallaxes are not available.},

Here, we present the overall distribution of sources within our Galactic disk. The submm continuum emission is confined to a narrow range around the Galactic plane, but shifted on average by \~{}0.07 deg below the plane. Source number counts show strong enhancements toward the Galactic center, the spiral arms, and toward prominent star-forming regions. Comparing the distribution of ATLASGAL dust continuum emission to that of young intermediate- to high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) derived from Spitzer data, we find similarities as well as differences. In particular, the distribution of submm dust continuum emission is significantly more confined to the plane than the YSO distribution (FWHM of 0.7 and 1.1 deg, corresponding to mean physical scale heights of approximately 46 and 80 pc, respectively). While this difference may partly be caused by the large extinction from the dense submm cores, gradual dispersal of stellar distributions after their birth could also contribute to this effect. Compared to other tracers of Galactic structure, the ATLASGAL data are strongly confined to a narrow latitude strip around the Galactic plane.},

@article{Peretto2009,
  abstract = {The majority of stars form in clusters. Therefore a comprehensive view of star formation requires understanding the initial conditions for cluster formation. The goal of our study is to shed light on the physical properties of infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) and the role they play in the formation of stellar clusters. This article, the first of a series dedicated to the study of IRDCs, describes techniques developed to establish a complete catalogue of Spitzer IRDCs in the Galaxy. We have analysed Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL data to identify a complete sample of IRDCs in the region of Galactic longitude and latitude 10deg < |l|<65deg and |b|<1deg. From the 8micron observations we have constructed opacity maps and used a newly developed extraction algorithm to identify structures above a column density of N\_\{H2\} > 1x10\^{}\{22\} cm\^{}\{-2\}. The 24micron data are then used to characterize the star formation activity of each extracted cloud. A total of 11303 clouds have been extracted. A comparison with the existing MSX based catalogue of IRDCs shows that 80\% of these Spitzer dark clouds were previously unknown. The algorithm also extracts \~{} 20000 to 50000 fragments within these clouds, depending on detection threshold used. A first look at the MIPSGAL data indicates that between 20\% and 68\% of these IRDCs show 24micron point-like association. This new database provides an important resource for future studies aiming to understand the initial conditions of star formation in the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {We examine the vertical structure and equilibrium of the molecular gas layer in the galactic disk, measuring its scale height and velocity dispersion as a function of Galactic radius by modeling the CO emission at the tangent points. The model takes into account emission from a large path length along the line of sight, corresponding to an interval $\backslash$Delta R \~{} 200-400 pc; and is parametrized by the scale height of the gas, the centroid in z, the rotation velocity and the velocity dispersion. This model is then fit to the \$\^{}\{12\}CO\$ survey of Knapp et al.(1985) to determine the best fit parameters. The reduced $\backslash$chi\^{}2 from fitting the models (considering only the photon statistics) range from 2 to 19. The main source of error is the `shot noise' due to the small number of clouds. Simulations using discrete molecular clouds are carried out to estimate the errors. The scale height of the molecular gas increases with radius. The velocity dispersion varies from \~{} 2 km/s to 11 km/s with a typical uncertainty of \~{}3 km/s and shows a monotonic increase with galactic radius. The midplane mass density of the disk calculated from the scale-height and velocity dispersion is consistent with the local value $\backslash$rho\_0(R\_0) of 0.2 $\backslash$msun pc\^{}\{-3\}.},

@article{Reid2004,
  abstract = {We report measurements with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) of the position of Sgr A* with respect to two extragalactic radio sources over a period of 8 yr. The apparent proper motion of Sgr A* relative to J1745-283 is 6.379+/-0.024 mas yr-1 along a position angle of 209.60d+/-0.18d, almost entirely in the plane of the Galaxy. The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this motion, and the residual proper motion of Sgr A* perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy is -0.4+/-0.9 km s-1. A maximum likelihood analysis of the motion expected for a massive object within the observed Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that Sgr A* contains more than about 10\% of the \~{}4×106 Msolar deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A*, as measured by several investigators, is less than 1 AU, and the implied mass density of \~{}1022 Msolar pc-3 is within about 3 orders of magnitude of a comparable supermassive black hole within its Schwarzschild radius. Our observations provide the first direct evidence that a compact radiative source at the center of a galaxy contains of order 106 Msolar and provides overwhelming evidence that it is in the form of a supermassive black hole. Finally, the existence of ``intermediate-mass'' black holes more massive than \~{}104 Msolar between roughly 103 and 105 AU from Sgr A* is excluded.},

@article{Shetty2006,
  abstract = {We investigate the formation of substructure in spiral galaxies using global MHD simulations, including gas self-gravity. Local modeling by Kim \&amp; Ostriker previously showed that self-gravity and magnetic fields cause rapid growth of overdensities in spiral arms; differential compression of gas flowing through the arms then results in the formation of sheared structures in the interarms. These sheared structures resemble features described as spurs or feathers in optical and IR observations of many spiral galaxies. Global modeling extends previous local models by including the full effects of curvilinear coordinates, a realistic log-spiral perturbation, self-gravitational contribution from five radial wavelengths of the spiral shock, and variation of density and epicyclic frequency with radius. We show that with realistic Toomre Q-values self-gravity and galactic differential rotation produce filamentary gaseous structures with kiloparsec-scale separations, regardless of the strength-or even presence-of a stellar spiral potential. However, a sufficiently strong spiral potential is required to produce true spurs, consisting of interarm structures emerging from gas concentrations in the main spiral arms. In models where Q is initially constant, filaments due to interarm self-gravity grow mainly in the outer regions, whereas true arm spurs grow only in the inner regions. For models with Q\~{}R, outer regions are intrinsically more stable, so background interarm filaments do not grow, but arm spurs can develop if the spiral potential is strong. Unlike independently growing background filaments, the orientation of arm spurs depends on galactic location. Inside corotation, spurs emanate outward, on the convex side of the arm; outside corotation, spurs grow inward, on the concave side of the arm. Based on orientation and the relation to arm clumps, it is possible to distinguish true spurs that originate as instabilities in the arms from independently growing background filaments. We measure spur spacings of \~{}3-5 times the Jeans length in the arm and arm clump masses of \~{}107 Msolar. Finally, we have also studied models without self-gravity, finding that magnetic fields suppress a purely hydrodynamic instability recently proposed by Wada \&amp; Koda as a means of growing interarm spurs and feathers. Our models also suggest that magnetic fields are important in preserving grand-design spiral structure when gas in the arms fragments via self-gravity into GMCs.},

  abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mapped the entire sky at mid-infrared wavelengths 3.4 $\mu$m, 4.6 $\mu$m, 12 $\mu$m, and 22 $\mu$m. The mission was primarily designed to extract point sources, leaving resolved and extended sources, for the most part, unexplored. Accordingly, we have begun a dedicated WISE Enhanced Resolution Galaxy Atlas (WERGA) project to fully characterize large, nearby galaxies and produce a legacy image atlas and source catalog. Here we demonstrate the first results of the WERGA project for a sample of 17 galaxies, chosen to be of large angular size, diverse morphology, and covering a range in color, stellar mass, and star formation. It includes many well-studied galaxies, such as M 51, M 81, M 87, M 83, M 101, and IC 342. Photometry and surface brightness decomposition is carried out after special super-resolution processing, achieving spatial resolutions similar to that of Spitzer Infrared Array Camera. The enhanced resolution method is summarized in the first paper of this two-part series. In this second work, we present WISE, Spitzer, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) photometric and characterization measurements for the sample galaxies, combining the measurements to study the global properties. We derive star formation rates using the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon sensitive 12 $\mu$m (W3) fluxes, warm-dust sensitive 22 $\mu$m (W4) fluxes, and young massive-star sensitive ultraviolet (UV) fluxes. Stellar masses are estimated using the 3.4 $\mu$m (W1) and 4.6 $\mu$m (W2) measurements that trace the dominant stellar mass content. We highlight and showcase the detailed results of M 83, comparing the WISE/Spitzer results with the Australia Telescope Compact Array H I gas distribution and GALEX UV emission, tracing the evolution from gas to stars. In addition to the enhanced images, WISE's all-sky coverage provides a tremendous advantage over Spitzer for building a complete nearby galaxy catalog, tracing both stellar mass and star formation histories. We discuss the construction of a complete mid-infrared catalog of galaxies and its complementary role of studying the assembly and evolution of galaxies in the local universe.},

@article{Malhotra1994b,
  abstract = {We examine the vertical structure and equilibrium of the molecular gas layer in the Galactic disk, measuring its scale height and velocity dispersion as a function of Galactic radius by modeling the CO emission at the tangent points. The model takes into account emission from a large path length along the line of sight, corresponding to an interval (delta R) of typically a few hundred parsecs in Galactic radius, and is parameterized by the scale height of the gas, the centroid in z, the rotation velocity, and the velocity dispersion; these parameters are assumed to be constant over the interval delta R. This model is then fitted to the (12)CO survey of Knapp, Stark, \&amp; Wilson (1985) to determine the best-fit parameters. The terminal velocity values are found to be in good agreement with those obtained from H I data. The chi-squared per degree of freedom from fitting the models (considering only the photon statistics) ranges from 2 to 19, with a median value of 6. The main source of error is found to be the 'shot noise' due to the small number of clouds. Simulations of the tangent point emission using discrete molecular clouds are carried out to estimate the errors. We use the observed radial distribution of molecular gas and the 'standard' size-line-width relation for molecular clouds in the simulations. Modeling the simulations gives values of chi-squared per degree of freedom similar to those obtained from modeling the observations. The scale height of the distribution is found to increase fairly monotonically with radius. The value of the velocity dispersion varies from approximately 2 to 11 km/s with a typical uncertainty of approximately 3 km/s. The variation in velocity dispersion is consistent with a monotonic increase with Galactic radius. The midplane mass density of the disk (rho0)(R) is calculated from the scale height and velocity dispersion (under the assumption that the velocity dispersion is isotropic) and is consistent with the local value (rho(sub0))(R0) of 0.2 solar masses/cu pc determined from stellar kinematics.},

@article{Peretto2009a,
  abstract = {The majority of stars form in clusters. Therefore a comprehensive view of star formation requires understanding the initial conditions for cluster formation. The goal of our study is to shed light on the physical properties of infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) and the role they play in the formation of stellar clusters. This article, the first of a series dedicated to the study of IRDCs, describes techniques developed to establish a complete catalogue of Spitzer IRDCs in the Galaxy. We have analysed Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL data to identify a complete sample of IRDCs in the region of Galactic longitude and latitude 10deg < |l|<65deg and |b|<1deg. From the 8micron observations we have constructed opacity maps and used a newly developed extraction algorithm to identify structures above a column density of N\_\{H2\} > 1x10\^{}\{22\} cm\^{}\{-2\}. The 24micron data are then used to characterize the star formation activity of each extracted cloud. A total of 11303 clouds have been extracted. A comparison with the existing MSX based catalogue of IRDCs shows that 80\% of these Spitzer dark clouds were previously unknown. The algorithm also extracts \~{} 20000 to 50000 fragments within these clouds, depending on detection threshold used. A first look at the MIPSGAL data indicates that between 20\% and 68\% of these IRDCs show 24micron point-like association. This new database provides an important resource for future studies aiming to understand the initial conditions of star formation in the Galaxy.},

This is done by comparison with an empirical mass-size threshold for massive star formation (MSF). We establish m(r)&gt;870 M sun(r/pc)1.33 as a novel approximate MSF limit, based on clouds with and without MSF. Many IRDCs, if not most, fall short of this threshold. Without significant evolution, such clouds are unlikely MSF candidates. This provides a first quantitative assessment of the small number of IRDCs evolving toward MSF. IRDCs below this limit might still form stars and clusters of up to intermediate mass, though (like, e.g., the Ophiuchus and Perseus Molecular Clouds). Nevertheless, a major fraction of the mass contained in IRDCs might reside in few 102 clouds sustaining MSF.},

@article{peretto2010:irdcs-mass-density,
  abstract = {How and when the mass distribution of stars in the Galaxy is set is one of the main issues of modern astronomy. Here, we present a statistical study of mass and density distributions of infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) and fragments within them. These regions are pristine molecular gas structures and progenitors of stars and so provide insights into the initial conditions of star formation. This study makes use of an IRDC catalog, the largest sample of IRDC column density maps to date, containing a total of $\sim$11,000 IRDCs with column densities exceeding N_H_2 = 1× 10^{22} cm-2 and over 50,000 single-peaked IRDC fragments. The large number of objects constitutes an important strength of this study, allowing a detailed analysis of the completeness of the sample and so statistically robust conclusions. Using a statistical approach to assigning distances to clouds, the mass and density distributions of the clouds and the fragments within them are constructed. The mass distributions show a steepening of the slope when switching from IRDCs to fragments, in agreement with previous results of similar structures. IRDCs and fragments are divided into unbound/bound objects by assuming Larson's relation and calculating their virial parameter. IRDCs are mostly gravitationally bound, while a significant fraction of the fragments are not. The density distribution of gravitationally unbound fragments shows a steep characteristic slope such as $\Delta$N/$\Delta$log(n) vprop n -4.0±0.5, rather independent of the range of fragment mass. However, the incompleteness limit at a number density of $\sim$103 cm-3 does not allow us to exclude a potential lognormal density distribution. In contrast, gravitationally bound fragments show a characteristic density peak at n $\sim$= 104 cm-3 but the shape of the density distributions changes with the range of fragment masses. An explanation for this could be the differential dynamical evolution of the fragment density with respect to their mass as more massive fragments contract more rapidly. The IRDC properties reported here provide a representative view of the density and mass structure of dense molecular clouds before and during the earliest stages of star formation. These should serve as constraints on any theoretical or numerical model to identify the physical processes involved in the formation and evolution of structure in molecular clouds.},

  abstract = {Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are a distinct class of interstellar molecular cloud identified as dark extinction features against the bright mid-infrared Galactic background. Here we present high angular resolution millimeter continuum images obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer toward four high-mass (200-1800 Msolar) IRDC cores that show evidence for active high-mass star formation (M>8 Msolar). We detect twelve bright (>7 mJy), compact (< 2, < 0.024 pc) condensations toward these cores. Two of the cores (G024.60+00.08 MM1 and G024.60+00.08 MM2) are resolved into multiple protostellar condensations, while one core (G022.35+00.41 MM1) shows two condensations. The remaining core (G024.33+00.11 MM1) contains a single, compact protostellar condensation with a very rich molecular spectrum, indicating that this is a hot molecular core associated with an early stage in the formation of a high-mass protostar. The derived gas masses for these condensations suggest that each core is forming at least one high-mass protostar (Mgas>8 Msolar), and three cores are also forming lower mass protostars (Mgas 2-5 Msolar). A comparison of the ratios of the gas masses (MG) to the Jeans masses (MJ) for IRDCs, cores, and condensations, provides broad support for the idea of hierarchical fragmentation. The close proximity of multiple protostars of disparate mass indicates that these IRDCs are in the earliest evolutionary states in the formation of stellar clusters. Based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).},
