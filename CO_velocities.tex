\subsubsection{CO Velocities}
\label{CO}
CO observations trace gas with mean density around 100 cm$^{-3}$.   CO emission associated with the Scutum-Centaurus Arm of the Milky Way \citep{Dame2011}\citep{Dame2001} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:COarm}, which presents a plane-of-the-sky map integrated over  $-50 <v_{LSR}< -30$ km\ s$^{-1}$.  The velocity range is centered on -40 km\ s$^{-1}$, the average velocity of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm in Nessie's longitude range (see Figures \ref{fig:topview} and \ref{fig:coloredlines}).  The white chalk line superimposed on Figure \ref{fig:COarm} is the same tracing of ``Nessie Optimistic" shown in Figure \ref{fig:FindingChart}.  The black feature labeled ``Nessie" refers to ``Nessie Classic."   

Judging by-eye vertical (latitude) centroid of the CO emission in Figure \ref{fig:COarm} appears to follow Nessie remarkably well, even out to the full $8^\circ$ (430 pc) extent of Nessie Optimistic.  We have also calculated a curve representing the locus of latitude centroids for CO in this velocity range, and even at this coarse resolution, a curve following Nessie's shape is clearly a better fit than a straight line passing through the CO centroids. 

Table 1 estimates that the Nessie IRDC has a typical ${\rm H_2}$ column density of $\sim 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a typical volume density of $\sim 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$.    Thus, the plane-of-the-sky coincidence of the line-of-sight-velocity-selected ``Scutum-Centaurus" CO emission  and the mid-IR extinction suggests that the Nessie IRDC may be a kind of dense ``spine" or ``bone" of this section of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, as traced by much-less-dense ($\sim 100$ cm$^{-3}$) CO-traced gas.  But, the spatial resolution of the CO map is too low ($8'$), and the 20 km\ s$^{-1}$ velocity range associated with the Arm in CO is too broad to decide based on this evidence alone whether Nessie is a well-centered ``spine" or just a long skinny feature associated with, but potentially significantly inclined to, the Scutum-Centaurus Arm.
