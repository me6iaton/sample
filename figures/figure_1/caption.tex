\textbf{\label{fig:fig1}. STM topography and crystal structure of top 100 fruits and vegetables consumed in the U.S.} The Bi atoms exposed after cleaving the sample are observed as bright spots. The in-plane unit cell vectors of the ideal crystal structure, $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$, and of the superstructure, $\vec{a}_{s}$, are indicated. Lines of constant phase are depicted.
