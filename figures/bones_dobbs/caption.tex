\textbf{\label{fig:simulation}}. Snapshot of a simulation of a 2 armed spiral galaxy, with heating and cooling, self gravity of the gas, and stellar feedback (Figure 1 of Dobbs & Pringle 2013). The gas is gathered together into GMCs in the spiral arms, and later becomes sheared into long, thin 'spurs', or 'feathers'. The snapshot is taken at a time of 250 Myr, shows the galaxy out to a radius of 7 kpc, and is from a simulation with 8 million particles.
