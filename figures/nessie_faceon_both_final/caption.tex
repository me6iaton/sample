\textbf{\label{fig:topview}}.For the fourth quadrant of the Milky Way, contours of constant LSR velocity of -30,-40,and-50 km s$^{-1}$ \citep[using a rotation curve from][ ]{McClureGriffiths2007} are superimposed on a cartoon model of the Milky Way. CO and dense gas observations (see below) give LSR velocities associated with Nessie (shown here as rainbow curve) near -40 km$^{-1}$, placing Nessie in the Scutum-Centaurus arm (highlighted in black), about 3.1 kpc from the Sun. Yellow-highlighted curves show positions in the Galaxy that would have the labeled value of Galactic Latitude ($b$) when viewed from the Sun.  In the \textbf{top panel}, \textit{only} the height of the Sun off the plane (taken to be 25 pc in this example) is considered in drawing the iso-b curves, and in the \textbf{bottom panel}, a 7 pc offset of the Galactic Center (see text), which causes an overall tilt of $0.12^\circ$ is \textit{also} taken into account.
