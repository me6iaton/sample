\textbf{\label{fig:HOPSoverlay}}.  Superposition of HOPS Sources, color-colored by ${\rm NH}_3$-determined LSR velocity.  Colored lines have the same meaning (predicted LSR velocity) as in Figure \ref{fig:coloredlines}, so the colorful dashed lines at $b\sim-0.5^\circ$, in both panels, represent the physical Galactic mid-plane, and the solid colorful lines indicate 20 pc above and below the plane. Agreement of the NH$_3$ and predicted LSR velocity (color) to within 2.5 km s$^{−1}$ is indicated by a \textit{white circle} around the HOPS symbol, and \textit{grey} circles indicate agreement to within 5 km s$^{−1}$. As in Figures \ref{fig:topview} and \ref{fig:coloredlines}: in the \textbf{top panel}, only a 25 pc offset of the Sun above is taken into account; and in the \textbf{bottom panel}, a 7 pc offset for the Galactic Center is also used in the calculations.
