\textbf{\label{fig:pvdiagram}}. Position-velocity diagram of CO and ${\rm NH}_3$.  Colored background shows CO emission integrated over $-1.5<b<1^\circ$.  Black dots show HOPS sources coincident with Nessie Extended, also shown in Figure \ref{fig:HOPSoverlay} as white-circle-highlighted colored points.  The dots are plotted at the longitudes given in Figure \ref{fig:HOPSoverlay}, and the LSR velocities given by the centroid of the ${\rm NH}_3$ emission for each HOPS source. The black line shown is {\it not} a fit to the HOPS or the CO data shown: it is a segment of a {\it global} log-spiral fit to CO data for the entire Scutum-Centaurus Arm, extending almost $360^{\circ}$ around the Galaxy (taken from Fig. 4 of \cite{2011ApJ...734L..24D}.
