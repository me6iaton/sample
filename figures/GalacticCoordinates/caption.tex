\textbf{\label{fig:galcoords}}. Schematic side-views of the of the physical mid-plane of the Galaxy with respect to the IAU-defined mid-plane. The drawings are {\bf not to scale}. In both panels, $z_{\rm Sun}$ represents the height of the Sun above the Galactic mid-plane.  In the \textbf{upper panel}, and in figures labeled "no tilt of plane" below, we consider \textit{only} the Sun's offset from the plane in calculating the observed coordinates of the true "physical" mid-plane.  In the \textbf{lower panel}, and in figures labeled "with tilt" below, we also take the offset, $z_{\rm SgrA*}$, of the Galactic Center (Sgr A*) into account.  For reference, if the distance to SgrA*, $d_{\rm SgrA*}$, is 8.5 kpc and  $z_{\rm Sun}$=25 pc and $z_{\rm SgrA*}=7$ pc (based on $b=-0.046^\circ$ for SgrA*) then the angle by which the IAU mid-plane is tilted with respect to the physical plane is $\theta_{\rm tilt}=0.12^\circ$ and the distance from the Sun to where the two planes cross is $d_{\rm crossing} =12$ kpc.
