\textbf{\label{fig:coloredlines}}. Predicted Sky Position and Radial Velocities for the Scutum-Centaurus Arm of the Milky Way.  The colored lines are color-coded by velocity, given in the color bar at the top.  The colored dashed line shows the predicted position for the Galactic Plane for the near side of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm (roughly 3.1 kpc from the Sun).  The solid colored lines show $\pm 20$ pc from the mid-Plane at the same ($\sim3.1$ kpc) distance.  The dashed white line, which (coincidentally) is nearly identical to the upper dashed-colored line, shows the predicted Sky position of the mid-plane for the far side of the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, and the two white dotted lines show  $\pm 20$ pc at for the far side Arm.  The overlays are calculated using a model of a (flat) Milky Way described by the parameters shown above the color bar. Background imagery is from Spitzer, as in Figure \ref{fig:FindingChart}.
