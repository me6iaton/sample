\textbf{\label{fig:FindingChart}.} Nessie ``Classic," ``Extended," and ``Optimistic."  It is recommended that this high resolution figure be viewed electronically, as zooming and panning are necessary to reveal the structures discussed.   Background imagery is a three-color image constructed from Spitzer where red shows MIPS 24 \micron, green IRAC 8.0 \micron, and blue IRAC 5.8 \micron. Image (brightness/contrast) adjustment used  emphasizes Nessie and also makes the image look a bit greener than is ``natural."  Yellow horizontal lines show $b=0^\circ$ and $b=-0.5^\circ$. Small white numbers show galactic longitude ($l$) in degrees. Full size version of this figure is available at \url{https://www.authorea.com/users/23/articles/249/master/file/figures/1nessie_findingchart/1nessie_findingchart_hires.jpg} (submit to Journal). A non-annotated high-dynamic-range view of this Spitzer image is available as a supplement to this paper at http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/22050. (Note that related figures below show less exaggerated contrast, and zoom in on the central portions of Nessie.)
