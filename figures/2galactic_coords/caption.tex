\textbf{\label{fig:galcoords}}. Schematic side-view of the tilt of the ``True" Galactic Plane with respect to the IAU-defined plane. The drawing is not to scale. The offset of the Sun above the True Galactic Plane, and of the Galactic Center (Sgr A*) below the IAU-defined plane, conspire to tilt the IAU system with respect to the True Plane (in this simplified view) by roughly $0.13^\circ$, meaning that the red and blue lines shown here cross at a distance roughly 12 kpc from the Sun.
