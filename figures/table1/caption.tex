\label{fig:table1} Estimates for the density and mass of Nessie, under various assumptions about its length.  The {\bf top set} of values shows estimates for a cylinder with radius, length, and average density appropriate to the Spitzer ``shadow" shown in Figure \ref{fig:FindingChart}.  The average density is set to $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ so as to achieve a visual extinction of $\sim 100$ magnitudes, consistent with the typical extinction on tenths of pc scales in an IRDC.  The {\bf lower set} of values is different only in that a density of 500 cm$^{-3}$ is used, as an estimate of the typical density of the region seen to emit in HNC by Jackson et al. 2010.
