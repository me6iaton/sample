\textbf{\label{fig:topview}}. Iso-velocity Contours in the 4th Quadrant of the Milky Way. For the rotation curve presented in \citet{McClureGriffiths2007}, colored contours, superimposed on the a cartoon representation of the Milky Way, show curves of equal radial velocity with respect to the local standard of rest. CO and dense gas observations (see below ) give LSR velocities associated with Nessie near -40 km/s, placing the feature near or in the Scutum-Centaurus arm, around 3.1 kpc from the Sun.
