\textbf{\label{fig:HOPSoverlay}}. Superposition of HOPS Sources, color-colored by ${\rm NH}_3$-determined LSR velocity.  Colored and white lines have the same meaning as in Figure \ref{fig:coloredlines}, so the colorful dashed line at $b\sim-0.5^\circ$ represents the Galactic mid-plane. xxNote that Bob Benjamin will ultimately adjust figures to make sure that the color-coding of the lines in Figure \ref{fig:coloredlines} and this Figure agree, using v$_{LSR}$ instead of v$_{rad}$, and we also have to decide whether to broaden this figure to show Nessie Optimistic, or just Nessie Extended, as-is.  (Lets make three versions of this figure: as-is, including Nessie ``extended'', and including all of Nessie ``optimistic''.  We can look at them and decide which to use.)  Also, regarding the two overlaid lines down the mid-plane, we need to make them more readable - perhaps two inter-spaced dashed lines?xx
