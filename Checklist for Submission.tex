\section{For Alberto, re:Authorea to LaTeX (ApJ)}

\begin{enumerate}
\item recover all high resolution figures
\item check formatting, completeness, and alphabetization of references, and accompanying in-line citations
\item put in ApJ compliant LaTeX format, in Google Drive directory for this paper
\item add appropriate Authorea acknowledgements, including to you!
\item put high-res figures in DataVerse, and ask C. Beaumont for access to "original" data used
\item prepare for submission to astro-ph (good test to see what's needed for that to be automated too?!)
\end{enumerate}
